While not all 36 designs were built, most of those that were constructed were built in Los Angeles, and one was built in Phoenix, Arizona. Of the unbuilt houses #19 was to have been built in Atherton, in the San Francisco Bay Area, while #27 was to have been built on the east coast, in Smoke Rise, New Jersey.

They identified hermit shelters, photographed an observation post between Valley of the Rope and Valley of the Three Pits, and cleared tombs known previously (QV 51 & QV 52).
